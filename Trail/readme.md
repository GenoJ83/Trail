Trail is a smart attendance system that uses an ESP32 microcontroller and RFID (RC522) technology to log student presence in real time. When a user scans their RFID tag, the ESP32 sends the data wirelessly to a Flask-based server, which records the entry and updates a live web dashboard. The system includes visual alerts via a buzzer and LED, and future versions will integrate a fingerprint sensor for enhanced verification. Trail is built to improve accuracy, reduce manual entry, and provide a digital attendance trail.
